    <h2>Conference information</h2>
    <p>This page provides all information required for conference attendees.
    </p>

    <p><b>It is currently under construction and to be finalised</b> </p>

    <h3>Venues</h3>
    <p>The conference is hosted at the 
    <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk">Blavatnik School of Government</a>
    and <a href="https://www.some.ox.ac.uk">Somerville College</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Talks and poster sessions are held at the Blavatnik. Please 
    see the 
    <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/contact-us-visitor-information">visitor
        information</a> page for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>Slack</h3>
    <p>The primary hub for organisation is the conference Slack workspace
    <a href="https://probgen22.slack.com">ProbGen22</a>. You should receive
    an invite to this workspace via email in the days before the 
    conference. If you have not received an invite or are having 
    difficulty getting access, please email the organisers 
    at <a href="mailto:probgen22@maillist.ox.ac.uk">probgen22@maillist.ox.ac.uk</a>.
    </p>

    <p>More information on how to best use the Slack workspace will be 
    posted in the coming days.</p>

    <h3>Talks</h3>

    <p>Talks are 15 minutes long, with 5 minutes allowed for questions 
    and changeover. Session chairs will be asked to keep strictly
    to schedule, so please do not overrun the alloted time. </p>

    <p>All talks take place at the Blatvatnik, and are streamed online using
    Zoom. Zoom links will be emailed to delegates and provided in the Slack workspace.
    </p>

    <p>Detailed information on preparing slides will be posted in the coming
    days.</p>

    <h3>Posters</h3>
    <p>Poster sessions will be held virtually on Slack, where each poster is 
    presented in its own
    channel. We encourage authors to be available in the channel during their appointed
    session.
    </p>

    <p>Even numbered poster IDs (as listed on the <a href="abstracts">abstracts</a>
    page) will be presented in the poster session on Monday, and 
    odd numbered IDs on Tuesday.
    </p>

    <p>An in-person poster reception will be held at the Blavatnik 
    in the spacious Inamori Forum. We hope that delegates will bring
    their laptops along to this reception so that we can enjoy the
    best of both in-person and online interactions.
    </p>

    <p>We ask poster presenters to prepare a poster summarising the research
    which can be displayed in their Slack channel. Additionally, 
    presenters may consider preparing a short (~3 minute) video 
    giving overview of the work which can also be pinned to the channel.
    This 
    is a very effective way of getting your message across to as many people
    as possible.
    </p>

    <p>Examples showing a suggested way of organising the poster channel
     will be added in the coming days.
    </p>

    <h3>Meals</h3>

    <p>
    Breakfast is included for delegates staying at Somerville college.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Lunch is not provided</b>. Because there is no conference activity
    during the mornings, we hope that attendees will take the opportunity to 
    explore Oxford, and to enjoy the many great food options available.
    Please see the <a href="information/index.html#food_and_drink">Food and drink</a> 
    section for more information.
    </p>

    <p>There will be regular tea and coffee breaks through the afternoon talk sessions.</p>

    <p>Dinner is provided at Somerville college for all in-person delegates each 
    evening.
    </p>

    <h3>Food and drink</h3>
    <a name="food_and_drink"></a>
    <p>
    Links to resources for food and drink will be added here in the coming days.
